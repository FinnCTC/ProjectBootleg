            <p>Hey everyone! It's with great excitement that we can say Project Bootleg is ready for launch!</p>
            <p>While we couldn't get the comments to work (code is very hard), we're satisfied with the website as of now.</p>
            <p>We hope you guys love Project Bootelg, and we can't wait to share the vast world of bootlegs with you!</p>

                <p>Hey everyone! Today, we want to introduce you to MiniDAD! MiniDAD is a AI developed by one of our coders!</p>
                <p>MiniDAD isn't on every page as of now (He can be... a bit tricky to control, to say the least), but he should be on the home page!</p>
                <p>Note from Dan: I'm getting reports of MiniDAD being on the about page and spewing nonsense. Please fix this, and remove this comment from the code afterwards.</p>
